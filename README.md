Library  Management  System  is  a  software  built  to  handle  the  primary  housekeeping  functions  of  a  library.  Libraries  rely  on  library  management  system  to  manage  asset  collections  as  well  as  relationships  with  their  member.  Library  management   systems  help  libraries  keep  track  of  the  books  and  their  checkouts.
	Library  Management  system  also  involve  maintaining  the  database  for  entering  new  books  , removing   book  and  deleting  book.
We  will  focus  on  following  set  off  requirements 
1]Any  library  member  should  be  able  to  search  books  by  their ID, name , author, categories.
2]There  could  be  more  than  one  copy  of  a  book.
3]There  should  be  a  maximum  limit  on  how  many  days  a member  can  keep.
4]The  system  should  be  able  to  add  book or student.
5]The  system  should  be  able  to  delete  book  or  student.
6]The  system  should  be  able  to  return  book.

My part is to create Add new student, panel window & return Book pages.
